        "    *Parallelism: Tasks that can be divided into smaller subtasks that can run independently and concurrently, such as web scraping, batch processing, map-reduce, etc. Multiprocessing can enable parallelism by creating a pool of processes that can execute a function across multiple input values.\n",

        "Multiprocessing and multithreading are two techniques that can improve the performance of a program by executing multiple tasks concurrently. However, they have some differences in how they achieve this goal.\n",
        "Multiprocessing is a technique that uses two or more CPUs or processors to run multiple processes simultaneously.A process is an instance of a program that has its own memory space and can execute independently. Multiprocessing can increase the computing power of a system by utilizing the available CPU cores or processors and avoiding the limitations of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) that prevents multiple threads from executing Python code at once.\n",
        "Multithreading is a technique that uses a single process with multiple threads to run multiple tasks simultaneously. A thread is a segment of code that can execute independently within a process and share the same memory space with other threads. Multithreading can increase the responsiveness and efficiency of a program by avoiding idle time and switching between tasks quickly.\n",

        "Some of the key differences between multiprocessing and multithreading are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Computing power: Multiprocessing can increase the computing power by adding more CPUs or processors, while multithreading can increase the computing power by using a single CPU or processor more effectively.\n",
        "2.Memory space: Multiprocessing uses separate memory space for each process, while multithreading uses shared memory space for all threads within a process.\n",
        "3.Communication: Multiprocessing requires inter-process communication mechanisms such as queues, pipes, locks, etc., while multithreading can communicate directly using shared variables or objects.\n",
        "4.Overhead: Multiprocessing has more overhead due to process creation, context switching, and communication, while multithreading has less overhead due to thread creation, context switching, and communication.\n",
        "5.Scalability: Multiprocessing is more scalable as it can use multiple machines or clusters, while multithreading is less scalable as it is limited by the number of cores or processors in a single machine."
